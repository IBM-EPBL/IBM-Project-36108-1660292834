1
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,426
Stop now.

2
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,062
Tell me where it is.

3
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:26,568
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

4
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:31,077
I don't know what you are talking about.

5
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,117
Is it a secret you will die for?

6
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,161
- Please.
- As you wish.

7
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,410
Wait!

8
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,586
My God, forgive me.

9
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,215
In the sacristy,

10
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,140
the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

11
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,138
Beneath the Rose.

12
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,971
Thank you.

13
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,130
Thank you.

14
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,133
Thank you.

15
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,241
Symbols are a language
that can help us understand our past.

16
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,950
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words,

17
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,032
but which words?

18
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,749
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind. Anybody?

19
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,172
- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.

20
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:12,671
Yes, yes, interesting.
But they would disagree with you in Spain.

21
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,094
There, they are robes worn by priests.

22
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,676
Now this symbol. Anyone?

23
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,885
Evil.

24
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,388
In English, please.

25
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,729
Devil's pitchfork.

26
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,024
Poor, poor Poseidon.

27
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,314
That is his trident.

28
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,193
A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

29
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,444
Now this symbol.

30
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,656
- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.

31
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,372
No. No, it's the pagan god Horus
and his mother Isis

32
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,417
centuries before the birth of Christ.

33
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,292
Understanding our past determines actively

34
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,590
our ability to understand the present.

35
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,841
So how do we sift truth from belief?

36
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,890
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally,

37
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,138
and thereby define ourselves?

38
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:06,019
How do we penetrate years, centuries,
of historical distortion

39
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,226
to find original truth?

40
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,737
Tonight, this will be our quest.

41
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,858
My son is a student of yours at Harvard.

42
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,319
- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Yeah.

43
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,495
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

44
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,370
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

45
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,376
He told me. Thank you.

46
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,919
Mr. Langdon?

47
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,921
Hi.

48
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,418
Bonjour, Professor.

49
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:37,426
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.

50
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,762
Will you take a look at this photo, please?

51
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,845
My police chief, Captain Fache, had hoped,

52
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,352
considering your expertise
and the markings on the body,

53
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,932
you might assist us.

54
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,701
Will you excuse me a moment?

55
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,206
I was supposed to have drinks with him
earlier this evening.

56
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,454
Yes, we know.

57
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,957
We found your name in his daily planner.

58
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,874
He never showed. I waited for over an hour.

59
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,801
Why would someone do this to him?

60
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,557
You misunderstand, Professor.

61
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,719
He was shot, yes.

62
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,555
But what you see in the photograph,

63
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,107
Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

64
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:38,657
Teacher, all four are dead.

65
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,577
The sénéchaux and the Grand Master himself.

66
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,831
Then I assume you have the location.

67
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,118
Confirmed by all.

68
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,707
Independently.

69
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,841
I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

70
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,467
The prospect of death is strong motivation.

71
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,309
It is here.

72
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,024
In Paris, Teacher.

73
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:19,407
It hides beneath the Rose in Saint-Sulpice.

74
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,651
You will go forth, Silas.

75
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,102
I chastise my body.

76
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,976
Captain Fache is waiting for you.

77
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,614
Okay.

78
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,335
- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.

79
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,796
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

80
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,336
You like our pyramid?

81
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,511
It's magnificent.

82
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,215
A scar on the face of Paris.

83
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,180
After me, please.

84
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,020
It's the pairing of those two pyramids.

85
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,942
It's unique.

86
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,194
The two are geometric echoes.

87
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,358
Fascinating.

88
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,619
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

89
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,951
How well did you know the curator?

90
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,331
Not very well.

91
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,005
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

92
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,425
Could we take the stairs?

93
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,401
So Saunière requested tonight's meeting.

94
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,610
Yes.

95
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,287
How? Did he call you?

96
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,201
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

97
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,463
- Had something to discuss.
- What?

98
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,217
You seem uncomfortable.

99
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:27,067
The Grande Galerie.
This is where you found the body.

100
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,943
How would you know that?

101
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,034
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid.

102
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,656
It's unmistakable.

103
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,292
Dear God.

104
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,670
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

105
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,848
Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult.

106
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,683
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

107
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,228
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

108
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,726
Perhaps a less defensive tack, Your Eminence.

109
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,933
The press continue to be harsh with us.

110
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,693
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

111
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,320
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

112
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,027
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

113
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,915
Does doctrine necessarily include
vows of chastity, tithing,

114
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,119
and atonement for sins
through self-flagellation and the cilice?

115
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,624
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

116
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,675
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetic lives.

117
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,846
- Why are some media...
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

118
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,597
Aringarosa.

119
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,515
Silas has succeeded. The legend is true.

120
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,721
It hides beneath the Rose.

121
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,062
My part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled.

122
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,695
I meet the council in an hour.

123
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,692
I will have your money tonight, Teacher.

124
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,493
The Vitruvian Man.

125
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,196
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.

126
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,873
And the star on his skin?

127
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,044
- A pentacle.
- And its meaning?

128
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,546
The pentacle is a pagan religious icon.

129
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,795
Devil worship.

130
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:15,219
No. No, no, no. The pentacle before that.

131
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,423
This is a symbol for Venus.

132
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,517
It represents the female half of all things.

133
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,562
You are telling me
that Saunière's last act on earth

134
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,733
was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

135
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,438
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

136
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,610
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol,

137
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,991
and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

138
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,572
- Is that so?
- Yes.

139
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,876
Then what do you make of this?

140
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:51,423
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint."

141
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,758
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.

142
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,013
What would you do if you had
such limited time to send a message?

143
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:05,062
Well, I suppose I'd try
to identify my killer.

144
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,054
Precisely.

145
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,391
Precisely.

146
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,600
So, Professor...

147
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,237
Officer Neveu.

148
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,939
Please, pardon the interruption.

149
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,023
This is not the time.

150
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,443
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

151
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,452
...and I've deciphered the code.

152
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,371
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

153
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,997
That's the code Saunière left on the floor.

154
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,074
Fibonacci?

155
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,410
Headquarters sent me to explain, captain.

156
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,961
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

157
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,379
The numbers are out of order.

158
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,458
But before that, I have an urgent message for
Professor Langdon.

159
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,587
Right?

160
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,419
Pardon me?

161
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,925
I'm Sophie Neveu, French police, Cryptology.

162
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,051
Your embassy called Division.

163
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,144
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

164
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,031
This is the number
of your embassy's messaging service.

165
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,442
Well, thank you.

166
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,997
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

167
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:14,081
Miss Neveu? This...

168
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,415
No. That's the right number.

169
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,921
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

170
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,092
But I'm getting...

171
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,047
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

172
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,438
Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.

173
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,111
You must follow my directions very closely

174
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,406
and, above all,
reveal nothing to Captain Fache.

175
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,529
You are in grave danger.

176
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,502
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

177
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,380
Good evening, Sister.

178
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,176
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

179
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,015
Of course, Father.

180
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,222
But so late?

181
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,470
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

182
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:15,392
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

183
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,569
It would be my pleasure.

184
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,592
There's been an accident. A friend.

185
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,141
- I have to fly home in the morning.
- I see.

186
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,185
Is there a restroom I could use?

187
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,513
I just wanna splash some water on my face.

188
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,768
Yes.

189
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,690
She said it is meaningless.

190
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,276
A mathematical joke.

191
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,115
Is it meaningless?

192
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,871
I'll take another look when I come back.

193
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,164
I'm sorry. Of course.

194
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,351
Do you have a message from Saunière?

195
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,679
What are you talking about?

196
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,273
Crazy old man.

197
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,067
You have me confused with someone else.

198
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,270
- I came here to...
- Check your jacket pocket.

199
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,860
Just look.

200
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,661
GPS tracking dot.

201
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,994
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

202
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,122
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket

203
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,172
in case you tried to run.

204
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,335
We have you on a little leash, Professor.

205
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,670
Why would I try to run? I didn't do anything.

206
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,925
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text

207
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,887
Fache wiped clean before you arrived?

208
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,605
He brought you here to force
a confession, Professor Langdon.

209
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,027
He's still in there? What's he doing?

210
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,614
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

211
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,199
He is sure you're guilty.

212
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,421
When did Saunière contact you?

213
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,965
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

214
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,042
What time? What time?

215
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,344
At 3:00. Around 3:00. 3:00.

216
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,219
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

217
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,640
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

218
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,143
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

219
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,565
Lady, stop it! Just stop!

220
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,476
Who are you?

221
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,240
Look at the letters.

222
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,952
"P.S."

223
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,034
P.S., postscript.

224
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,249
"Princess Sophie." Silly, I know.

225
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,078
But I was only a girl when I lived with him.

226
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,047
Jacques Saunière was my grandfather.

227
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,559
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

228
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,688
If you help me understand why

229
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,438
I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

230
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,438
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

231
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,443
No.

232
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,157
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

233
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,251
What exactly do you propose?

234
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,642
Saunière was reading his book.

235
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,019
"Blood trail."

236
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,856
Excuse me, captain.

237
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,109
We have a problem.

238
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,313
Headquarters didn't send Sophie Neveu.

239
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,740
What?

240
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,324
Captain, look at this.

241
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,156
He jumped!

242
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,832
Shit.

243
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,167
He's moving again. And fast.

244
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,920
He must be in a car.

245
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,304
He's going south on Pont du Carrousel.

246
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,310
Bastard.

247
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,590
That cop will check the whole lower floor.

248
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,842
I will only take a moment.

249
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,591
Of course.

250
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,480
He is much older than I remember.

251
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,617
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

252
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,721
He phoned my office today. Several times.

253
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,926
He said it was a matter of life and death.

254
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,770
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

255
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,230
It seems when he couldn't speak to me,

256
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,479
he reached out to you.

257
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,916
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

258
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,879
This is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong.

259
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:05,142
The Fibonacci numbers only make sense
when they're in order.

260
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,764
These are scrambled.

261
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:10,599
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

262
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,558
Would you hold this, please?

263
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,979
This phrase is meaningless.

264
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:23,620
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

265
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:24,866
An anagram.

266
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,422
You have eidetic memory?

267
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,259
Not quite.
But I can pretty much remember what I see.

268
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,574
Anagram is right.

269
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,536
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint" becomes

270
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,243
"Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa."

271
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,251
Professor, the Mona Lisa is right over here.

272
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:27,725
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

273
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,677
Smart to hit the truck.

274
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,602
What, you admire him now?

275
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,318
We're stupid. Who did we leave at the museum?

276
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,229
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

277
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,528
Her smile is in the lower
spatial frequencies.

278
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,407
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

279
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,612
Why?

280
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:52,200
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

281
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,456
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

282
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,254
There. Blood.

283
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:06,839
Hey.

284
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,135
"So dark the con of man."

285
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,272
No. It doesn't say that.

286
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,775
Is it another anagram? Can you break it?

287
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,157
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

288
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,787
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

289
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:33,958
Demons. Omens. Codes. Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

290
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,285
Madonna of the Rocks.

291
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,127
Da Vinci.

292
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,256
Careful. Careful.

293
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,560
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

294
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,063
It was Saunière's.

295
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,654
I remember finding it once when I was a girl.

296
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,741
He'd promised he'd give it to me one day.

297
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,869
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

298
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,446
"So dark the con of man"?

299
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,156
No. Have you?

300
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,869
When you were a child,
were you aware of any secret gatherings?

301
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,371
Anything ritualistic in nature?

302
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,792
Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?

303
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,503
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

304
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,552
The what? Why are you asking these things?

305
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,805
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

306
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,137
One of the world's oldest
and most secret societies,

307
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,726
with leaders like Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

308
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,901
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

309
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,696
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to

310
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,024
as "the dark con of man."

311
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,988
But what secret?

312
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:37,828
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on Earth.

313
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,625
I can't do this by myself.

314
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,217
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

315
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,388
Please.

316
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,932
- Even if we could get out of this...
- Okay.

317
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,424
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

318
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,399
Well, that was...

319
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,026
We need to get out of sight.

320
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,964
Christ, give me strength.

321
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:29,519
You are a ghost.

322
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,150
Christ, give me strength.

323
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,062
Stealing in a house of God!

324
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,410
You are an angel.

325
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,915
Christ, give me strength.

326
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,571
You have powerful friends.

327
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,450
Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me.

328
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,035
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

329
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,379
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

330
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,456
The light is not ideal.

331
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,545
Tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line.

332
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:25,138
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

333
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:30,139
Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers

334
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,101
mark the world's first prime meridian

335
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,606
which passed through this very church.

336
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,528
It hides beneath the Rose.

337
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,904
I'm sorry?

338
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,567
Sister.

339
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,577
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

340
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,910
I insist.

341
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,088
May the peace of the Lord be with you.

342
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,132
And with you.

343
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,857
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

344
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:26,533
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

345
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,204
A decoy, I'm sure.

346
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,874
All the same, send an officer to the station.

347
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,702
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

348
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,751
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

349
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,880
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

350
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,012
Robert Langdon is guilty.

351
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,223
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

352
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,150
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

353
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,407
Stay here.

354
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,456
Police.

355
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,293
What do you want?

356
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,925
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

357
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,300
Go and get something to eat.

358
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,152
Did it ever occur to you
that could be dangerous?

359
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,455
No. And now we have a place to think.

360
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,915
Any ideas, Professor?

361
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,667
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

362
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,837
"What's the next step?"

363
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,002
With him, it's always,

364
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,180
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

365
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,432
Puzzles.

366
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,850
Codes.

367
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,931
A treasure hunt.

368
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,767
To find his killer.

369
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,446
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

370
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,650
I hope not.

371
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,701
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

372
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,246
It all started over a thousand years ago
when a French king

373
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,749
conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.

374
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,503
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history,

375
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:29,212
was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood,

376
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,466
the Priory of Sion

377
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,846
and their military arm, the Knights Templar.

378
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,432
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

379
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,642
That was a cover to hide their true goal,
according to this myth.

380
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,194
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact

381
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,192
lost since the time of Christ.

382
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:52,401
An artifact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.

383
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,495
Did they find it, this buried treasure?

384
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,948
Put it this way.

385
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,496
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

386
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,416
They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.

387
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,915
Whether they blackmailed the papacy

388
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,342
or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.

389
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:13,593
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights,

390
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,302
these Knights Templar, of limitless power.

391
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,764
By the 1300s,
the Templars had grown too powerful.

392
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,268
Too threatening.

393
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,688
So the Vatican issued secret orders

394
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,900
to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

395
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:33,526
The Pope had declared
the Knights Templar Satan worshipers

396
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,829
and said God had charged him
with cleansing the Earth of these heretics.

397
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,665
The plan went off like clockwork.

398
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,994
The Templars were all but exterminated.

399
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:48,298
The date was October 13, 1307. A Friday.

400
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,258
Friday the 13th.

401
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,130
The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory's treasure,

402
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,805
but they found nothing.

403
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,434
The few surviving Knights of the Priory
had vanished,

404
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,558
and the search for
their sacred artifact began again.

405
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,016
What artifact?
I've never heard about any of this.

406
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,477
Yes, you have.

407
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,604
Almost everyone on Earth has.

408
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,232
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

409
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,833
Please, Saunière thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

410
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,832
Maybe more than that.

411
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:30,875
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

412
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:35,508
This metal here underneath is much newer,
and there's a modern ID stamp.

413
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,759
"Haxo 24."

414
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,762
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

415
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,691
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

416
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,022
He left us, Professor.

417
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:56,157
And vingt-quatre Haxo, it's not an ID stamp.

418
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,526
It's a street address.

419
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,041
This is Jacques Saunière.

420
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,252
Please leave a message after the tone.

421
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,331
Please, Monsieur Saunière, pick up the phone.

422
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,083
This is Sandrine Bieil.

423
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,586
I have called the list.

424
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,925
I fear the other guardians are dead.

425
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,428
The lie has been told.

426
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,680
The floor panel has been broken.

427
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,768
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

428
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,564
Job 38, verse 11.

429
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,273
Do you know it, Sister?

430
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,814
Job 38:11.

431
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:41,737
"Hitherto shalt thou come but no further."

432
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,909
"But no further."

433
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,911
Do you mock me?

434
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,917
Where is the keystone?

435
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,669
I do not know.

436
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,837
No.

437
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,509
You are a sister of the Church

438
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,349
and yet you serve them, the Priory.

439
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,356
Jesus had but one true message, that...

440
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,084
Come, you saints of God.

441
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,622
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

442
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,125
To receive her soul.

443
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:42,135
And bring her to the sight of the Almighty.

444
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,321
Welcome, Bishop.

445
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,240
This council is convened.

446
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,253
Our words shall never pass these walls.

447
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,008
What business, say you?

448
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,091
As you know, my request for funds...

449
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:30,020
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

450
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,978
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, Bishop?

451
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:40,398
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

452
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,943
How humble.

453
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,822
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

454
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,448
How dare you presume to...

455
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,245
I do not presume, I act!

456
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:52,618
The Vatican's unwillingness to support us
is both impious and cowardly.

457
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:57,039
Blood is being spilled because
true Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

458
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,925
This council has forgotten its very purpose.

459
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:08,475
Tonight, the Grail will be destroyed.

460
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:12,099
The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.

461
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:24,566
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

462
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,704
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

463
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,081
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

464
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,923
Because of your expertise?

465
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,679
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.

466
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,223
Do you think that's why
Saunière sought you out?

467
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:53,019
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

468
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:57,190
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

469
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,399
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

470
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,820
What was it?

471
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,790
How may I help you?

472
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,964
The door to the right, please.

473
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,111
Good evening. I am André Vernet,
the night manager.

474
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:51,862
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

475
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,779
Yes.

476
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,832
Understood.

477
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,079
Keys are often passed on

478
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,880
and first-time users
are sometimes uncertain of protocol.

479
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,508
Keys are essentially numbered Swiss accounts.

480
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,635
Often willed through generations.

481
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,018
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

482
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,141
The shortest safety-deposit-box lease
is 50 years.

483
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,189
And what's your longest account?

484
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,986
Quite a bit longer.

485
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,065
Technologies change, keys are updated.

486
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,239
Once the computer confirms your key,

487
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,371
enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

488
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,545
The room is yours, as long as you like.

489
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,762
What if I lost track of my account number?

490
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,805
How might I recover it?

491
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,768
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number

492
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,972
known only to the account bearer.

493
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,148
I hope you manage to remember it.

494
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,393
A single wrong entry disables the system.

495
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,575
- Ten.
- Ten.

496
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,200
Your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence.

497
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,660
Scrambled, unscrambled?

498
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,920
Unscrambled.

499
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,252
It's your key.

500
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,681
Funny, I don't even like history.

501
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,306
I've never seen much good
come from looking to the past.

502
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,272
Moment of truth.

503
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,491
My God. I don't believe this.

504
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,075
A rose.

505
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,752
The rose was a symbol for the Holy Grail.

506
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:51,590
Forgive the intrusion.

507
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,795
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than anticipated.

508
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,672
You must follow me, please.

509
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,257
For your own safety.

510
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,350
You knew they were coming?

511
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,269
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

512
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:07,349
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

513
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,684
It includes a safe-passage clause.

514
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,022
Safe passage?

515
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:15,190
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

516
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,569
In there?

517
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,548
Hey, is there a problem?

518
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,422
Good evening, sir. Police.

519
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,976
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

520
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,344
- English?
- Yes.

521
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:49,395
We are looking for two criminals.

522
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:53,562
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

523
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,698
Would you mind opening the hold?

524
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,862
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

525
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,946
You don't have keys to your own truck?

526
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,749
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

527
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,001
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

528
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:16,918
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

529
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,510
What?

530
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,594
This piece of shit.

531
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,550
Forty euros in Barbés.

532
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,759
Yours for 35.

533
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,519
No, no, no.

534
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,438
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

535
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,308
- Come on, 30?
- I said, no!

536
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,018
Move along!

537
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:48,665
Now we wait.

538
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,460
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

539
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,880
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

540
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:59,381
Yes, I have.
And I have given him an angel to do his will.

541
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,256
For surely there is no better soldier
for God than my Silas.

542
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,061
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

543
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,061
...to do penance and to amend my life.

544
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,350
Amen.

545
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,325
The Holy Grail.

546
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:37,090
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

547
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,461
It's nonsense.

548
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,340
You don't believe in God.

549
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,337
No.

550
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,798
Just people.

551
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,685
Sometimes that they can be kind.

552
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,647
Are you a God-fearing man, Professor?

553
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,025
I was raised a Catholic.

554
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,528
Well, that's not really an answer.

555
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,866
Professor, are you okay?

556
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,527
Go ahead, open it.

557
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,408
Go on.

558
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:16,879
A cryptex.

559
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,667
They are used to keep secrets.

560
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,587
It's da Vinci's design.

561
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,761
You write the information on a papyrus scroll

562
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,937
which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

563
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:36,312
If you force it open, the vial breaks,

564
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,064
vinegar dissolves papyrus,

565
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,572
and your secret is lost forever.

566
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,112
The only way to access the information

567
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:51,824
is to spell out the password
with these five dials, each with 26 letters.

568
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:56,745
That's 12 million possibilities.

569
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,999
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

570
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,586
Saunière made one for me once.

571
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,771
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

572
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,605
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

573
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,652
Come on.

574
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,408
Please, you're not all right.

575
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,246
May I try something?

576
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,498
I don't know why it works.

577
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,456
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

578
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,625
You think?

579
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,505
Yes.

580
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,262
Feeling better, Sophie?

581
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:12,661
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

582
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,164
I was four.

583
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,534
I'm sorry.

584
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,833
It was many years ago.

585
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,763
Better?

586
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,516
Yeah.

587
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,435
Okay.

588
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,138
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box,

589
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,762
and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

590
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,390
I don't know what you're talking about.

591
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,393
All right! Okay!

592
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,223
Right now!

593
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,693
Step back!

594
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:41,079
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

595
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,291
Turn around.

596
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,002
Turn around!

597
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,255
You too, mademoiselle.

598
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,195
Sophie!

599
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,360
Get in the truck!

600
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,453
I'll drive! Hurry!

601
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,820
What happened between you
and your grandfather, exactly?

602
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:57,194
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

603
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,910
I need to know.

604
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,908
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

605
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,788
You call him by his last name.

606
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,586
You say you hate history.

607
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,084
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

608
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,166
So now you're a psychologist too?

609
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:17,221
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

610
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,764
What do you mean, groom me?

611
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,093
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

612
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:26,181
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

613
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,642
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

614
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,853
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

615
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,615
I'm out of my field here.

616
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:48,332
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

617
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,292
An Englishman, lives here in France.

618
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,998
Do you trust this man?

619
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,671
I hope you can.

620
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,104
It seems you're not a driver at all.

621
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:14,733
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

622
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,069
You think you're in pain now, André Vernet?

623
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:22,487
My cause is worth your life. Understand?

624
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,417
What do you want?

625
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:33,999
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

626
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,349
Please wait. I'll see if he's available.

627
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,343
It's on the wrong side.

628
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:49,054
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

629
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:52,266
Robert! Do I owe you money?

630
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,020
Leigh, my friend,

631
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:59,198
care to open up for an old colleague?

632
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,991
- Of course.
- Thank you.

633
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,240
But first, a test of honor.

634
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,329
Three questions.

635
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,959
Fire away.

636
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,456
Your first.

637
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,335
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

638
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,708
Tea, of course.

639
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,963
Excellent.

640
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,340
Second. Milk or lemon?

641
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,426
Milk?

642
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,221
That would depend on the tea.

643
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,393
Correct.

644
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:33,479
And now the third
and most grave of inquiries.

645
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:39,106
In which year did a Harvard sculler
out-row an Oxford man at Henley?

646
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:50,283
Surely such a travesty has never occurred.

647
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,785
Your heart is true.

648
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,003
You may pass.

649
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,174
Welcome to Château Villette.

650
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,713
The truck's signal is coming online.

651
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,344
It's about time.

652
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,720
Locked on and tracking, sir.

653
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,981
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

654
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:23,031
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Château Villette.

655
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:27,286
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

656
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:44,928
Aringarosa.

657
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,893
I still don't know why he put you into this

658
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,524
and I'm sorry.

659
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:10,454
But I'm also very glad.

660
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,388
You are requested to make yourself at home.

661
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,855
Robert!

662
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,529
And you travel with a maiden, it seems.

663
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:48,075
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

664
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,278
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

665
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:54,498
It's an honor to welcome you...

666
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,209
...even though it's late.

667
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:01,130
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

668
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:05,418
So late, mademoiselle, it's almost early.

669
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,672
What a lovely smile you have.

670
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,008
Earl Grey?

671
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:14,809
Lemon.

672
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,636
Correct.

673
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,785
Château Villette. Yes.

674
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,589
A dramatic late-night arrival.

675
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:46,542
What can an old cripple do for you, Robert?

676
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,339
We wanna talk about the Priory of Sion.

677
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,722
The keepers?

678
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:54,884
The secret war?

679
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,968
Sorry for all the mystery.

680
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,981
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

681
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,515
You?

682
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:06,604
- Really?
- Not without your help.

683
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,240
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

684
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,532
Not if it works.

685
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,284
There are always four.

686
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:20,201
The Grand Master and the three sénéchaux

687
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:23,833
make up the primary guardians of the Grail.

688
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,715
Thank you, Remy. That'll be all for now.

689
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,767
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

690
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:42,394
Philippe de Chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

691
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,600
And that is what they want you to believe.

692
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,229
The Priory is charged with a single task.

693
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,823
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

694
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,447
The source of God's power on Earth.

695
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,278
No, that's a common misunderstanding.

696
01:00:56,403 --> 01:01:01,034
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on Earth.

697
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,330
The Holy Grail.

698
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,621
I don't understand.

699
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:09,834
What power? Some magic dishes?

700
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:14,680
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

701
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:33,073
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

702
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:38,404
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man.

703
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,238
The pagan emperor Constantine.

704
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,783
I thought Constantine was a Christian.

705
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:46,040
Hardly, no. He was a lifelong pagan

706
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,747
who was baptized on his deathbed.

707
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,629
Constantine was Rome's supreme holy man.

708
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,253
From time immemorial,

709
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:58,933
his people had worshiped a balance
between nature's male deities

710
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:02,511
and the goddess or sacred feminine.

711
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,853
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

712
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,517
Three centuries earlier,

713
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,400
a young Jew named Jesus had come along,

714
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,982
preaching love and a single God.

715
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:18,072
Centuries after his crucifixion,

716
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,204
Christ's followers had grown exponentially

717
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,374
and had started a religious war
against the pagans.

718
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:32,875
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

719
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,761
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

720
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,056
But we can at least agree
that the conflict grew to such proportions

721
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,804
that it threatened to tear Rome in two.

722
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:46,271
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan,

723
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,064
but he was also a pragmatist.

724
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,642
And in 325 Anno Domini,

725
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:55,947
he decided to unify Rome
under a single religion, Christianity.

726
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:59,868
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

727
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:03,497
And to strengthen
this new Christian tradition,

728
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,245
Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering

729
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,873
known as the Council of Nicaea.

730
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,962
And at this council,

731
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:15,793
the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well,

732
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:20,130
everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels

733
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,760
to the date for Easter

734
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,810
to the administering of the sacraments,
and of course,

735
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,057
the immortality of Jesus.

736
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,014
I don't follow.

737
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:32,310
Well, ma chère, until that moment in history,

738
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:37,239
Jesus was viewed by many
of his followers as a mighty prophet,

739
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:41,160
as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

740
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,411
A mortal man.

741
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,908
Not the Son of God?

742
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,616
Not even his nephew twice removed.

743
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:51,545
Constantine did not create Jesus' divinity.

744
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:55,590
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

745
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,508
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

746
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,758
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

747
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:05,593
Fact. For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

748
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,677
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

749
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:10,310
Absurd. There was even a formal
announcement of his promotion.

750
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,356
They couldn't even agree on the Nicene Creed!

751
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:15,857
Excuse me. "Who is God, who is man?"

752
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:23,444
How many have been murdered
over this question?

753
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,326
As long as there has been a one true God,

754
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,578
there has been killing in his name.

755
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,752
Now let me show you the Grail.

756
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,470
I trust you recognize The Last Supper,

757
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:50,554
the great fresco by Leonardo da Vinci.

758
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,684
Now, my dear, if you would close your eyes.

759
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,610
Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

760
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,530
You asked for my help, I recall.

761
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,233
Allow an old man his indulgences.

762
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:11,079
Now, mademoiselle, where is Jesus sitting?

763
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,501
- In the middle.
- Good.

764
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,420
He and his disciples are breaking bread.

765
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,295
And what drink?

766
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,376
Wine. They drank wine.

767
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,882
Splendid. And one final question.

768
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:26,636
How many wineglasses are there on the table?

769
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,389
One? The Holy Grail?

770
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,469
Open your eyes.

771
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,058
No single cup.

772
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,858
No chalice.

773
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,812
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

774
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,990
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend

775
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:48,366
celebrate this moment
as the definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

776
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,038
Now, Robert, you could be of help to us.

777
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:58,042
If you'd be so kind as to show us
the symbols for man and woman, please.

778
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,925
No balloon animals. I can make a great duck.

779
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:09,216
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

780
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,552
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

781
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,728
This is known as the blade.

782
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,889
It represents aggression and manhood.

783
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,725
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

784
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:23,105
Yes, the more penises you have,
the higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

785
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:27,614
Now, as you would imagine,
the female symbol is its exact opposite.

786
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:28,989
This is called the chalice.

787
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:34,245
And the chalice resembles
a cup or vessel or, more importantly,

788
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,497
the shape of a woman's womb.

789
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,797
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

790
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:45,844
It is quite literally
this ancient symbol of womanhood.

791
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:52,218
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful

792
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:56,601
that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

793
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,147
Wait, please.

794
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:02,774
You're saying the Holy Grail is a person?
A woman?

795
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:07,616
And it turns out,
she makes an appearance right there.

796
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,780
But they are all men.

797
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,320
Are they?

798
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,905
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord,

799
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,707
seated in the place of honor?

800
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,377
Flowing red hair.

801
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,793
Folded feminine hands.

802
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,380
Hint of a bosom. No?

803
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,260
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

804
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,970
Who is she?

805
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:40,140
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

806
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:41,562
The prostitute?

807
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:43,985
She was no such thing.

808
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:48,991
Smeared by the Church in 591 Anno Domini,
poor dear.

809
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:54,241
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

810
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:03,380
This is an old wives' tale.

811
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,047
The original one, in fact.

812
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:07,217
There's virtually no empirical proof.

813
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,720
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

814
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,422
Theories. There are theories.

815
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,679
Notice how Jesus and Mary are clothed.

816
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,391
Mirror images of each other.

817
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,064
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

818
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,734
And venturing into the even more bizarre,

819
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:28,689
notice how Jesus and Mary
appear to be joined at the hip

820
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,398
and are leaning away from each other

821
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:35,032
as if to create a shape
in the negative space between them.

822
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:39,374
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

823
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,458
Yes. And Robert, notice what happens

824
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,962
when these two figures change position.

825
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,211
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

826
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,088
No. But history,

827
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,303
she does make it true.

828
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:59,727
Now, listen to this.
It's from the Gospel according to Philip.

829
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:00,928
Philip?

830
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:04,107
Yes, it was rejected at the Council of Nicaea

831
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:08,983
along with any other gospels that made
Jesus appear human and not divine.

832
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:13,989
"And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.

833
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:18,205
"Christ loved her more than all the disciples

834
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,997
"and used to kiss her on the..."

835
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,326
But this says nothing of marriage.

836
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:26,333
Well, actually... Robert.

837
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:31,585
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

838
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:36,264
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

839
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:39,096
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

840
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,270
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

841
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,433
"And Peter said, 'Did he prefer her to us?'

842
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,769
"And Levi answered,

843
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,947
"'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

844
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:57,618
"If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

845
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:02,416
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene

846
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:06,336
that it's up to her to continue his Church.

847
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,127
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

848
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:14,302
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

849
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:19,933
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

850
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:25,730
Now, my dear,
the word in French for Holy Grail.

851
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:30,435
From the Middle English "Sangreal,"

852
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:33,237
of the original Arthurian legend.

853
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:38,443
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

854
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:43,240
It means "royal blood."

855
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:48,544
When the legend speaks of
the chalice that held the blood of Christ,

856
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:54,255
it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

857
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:58,171
But how could Christ
have a bloodline unless...

858
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:01,098
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

859
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:14,320
For her own safety
and for that of Christ's unborn child,

860
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:17,444
she fled the Holy Land and came to France.

861
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:22,620
And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

862
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,324
They know the child's name.

863
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,160
- A little girl.
- Yes.

864
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,587
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

865
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:32,709
Why?

866
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:36,544
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

867
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,469
People found God through sex?

868
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,639
In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven,

869
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,558
but the modern Church has a monopoly on that

870
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,685
in salvation through Jesus Christ.

871
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:50,015
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

872
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:52,441
Women, then, are a huge threat to the Church.

873
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,444
The Catholic Inquisition soon publishes

874
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,820
what may be the most blood-soaked book
in human history.

875
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,401
The Malleus Maleficarum.

876
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,404
The Witches' Hammer.

877
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:08,333
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill

878
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,829
all freethinking women.

879
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,049
In three centuries of witch hunts,

880
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:20,303
50, 000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

881
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:23,006
At least that. Some say millions.

882
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,307
Imagine, then, Robert,

883
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,680
that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

884
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,684
You asked what would be worth killing for.

885
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,862
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

886
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:41,024
This is the secret that the Priory of Sion

887
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,485
has defended for over 20 centuries.

888
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:46,742
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

889
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:51,000
The keepers of the proof of our true past.

890
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:55,080
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ

891
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,958
and Mary Magdalene.

892
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:09,970
Sir Leigh?

893
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:14,061
Sometimes I wonder who is serving whom.

894
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,814
His sauces are not that fantastic.

895
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,780
Yes, can I help you?

896
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:23,904
Yes. They're on the news now.

897
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:30,369
Living descendants? Is it possible?

898
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,075
It's not impossible.

899
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:37,001
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

900
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,002
You are wanted for four murders!

901
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,588
That's why Vernet said, "Killing spree."

902
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:45,422
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

903
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:48,098
- That's why he needed you, Sophie.
- You will leave my house!

904
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,176
- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm calling the police.

905
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,261
Jacques Saunière was her grandfather.

906
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,350
You're the obsessive Priory scholar, Leigh.

907
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,686
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

908
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,697
I'll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

909
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,153
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?

910
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:11,035
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

911
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:16,540
Consider. Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

912
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,873
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other sénéchaux dead?

913
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,209
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

914
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:26,303
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

915
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:28,222
Someone outside the society.

916
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:33,057
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

917
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:38,475
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

918
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,977
Not really.

919
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,780
No, that's impossible.

920
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,573
Can that really...

921
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,243
Is it the keystone?

922
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:59,245
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

923
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,501
Will you just tell us what the hell it's for?

924
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,105
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

925
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,446
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

926
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,364
Yes.

927
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,372
As the legend foretold,

928
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,459
"It hides beneath the Rose."

929
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,131
Oh, my.

930
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,515
Leigh.

931
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,394
Leigh?

932
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,309
Please.

933
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,515
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

934
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,982
Inside the keystone,

935
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:08,940
there'll be a map.

936
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,822
A map that will lead us to the Holy Grail.

937
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,704
To be trained by the Grand Master himself.

938
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:23,004
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

939
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:28,543
And he must have sung you the riddle songs.

940
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:30,173
I know some of them.

941
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,271
Can you keep secrets?

942
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,727
Can you know a thing and never say it again?

943
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:47,858
And codes?

944
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:53,151
I imagine they lie down for you like lovers.

945
01:16:56,153 --> 01:17:01,159
A sénéchal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

946
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:04,212
Tell him, please. I don't know any of this.

947
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:07,207
Leigh, it's not that simple. She doesn't...

948
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,001
Robert!

949
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,716
Do not move, woman.

950
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:21,971
Cripple.

951
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,895
Put the box on the table.

952
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,436
What, this trifle?

953
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:32,649
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

954
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:36,239
Put the keystone on the table.

955
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,821
You will not succeed.

956
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:44,289
Only the worthy can unlock the stone.

957
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,070
Rip the gate down.

958
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,288
Well, well, my dear.

959
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:26,794
Sit down.

960
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,374
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

961
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,707
- Are you?
- Yeah.

962
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:33,213
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

963
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:35,465
Get something to restrain this monster.

964
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:42,226
Above the joint.

965
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:47,143
Fortunately, a dragon most easy to slay.

966
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,270
He's wearing a cilice.

967
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,278
- A what?
- Well, look.

968
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:57,742
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

969
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:58,942
Opus Dei.

970
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:00,528
Fache is Opus Dei.

971
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:05,124
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

972
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,200
Robert.

973
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:12,461
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

974
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:14,708
Leigh?

975
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,341
You want what's in this box?

976
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,848
We need a way out of here.

977
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:26,145
Well, actually, I do have a plane.

978
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,241
- Robert! Where do we go?
- Come along.

979
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,159
- In here. Come in.
- Over here.

980
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,829
Get the door. Hurry

981
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,912
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

982
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,244
Watch out!

983
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,246
Be careful.

984
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,546
Come, Rem...

985
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,723
Shit.

986
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:06,848
Easy.

987
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:30,959
Jesus!

988
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,082
Apropos.

989
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:36,715
I can't imagine what your complaint is.

990
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,794
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

991
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,338
Put that away. We might need him.

992
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,256
Better.

993
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,890
Opus Dei.

994
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,477
- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.

995
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,483
Opus Dei is a prelature to the Vatican.

996
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:02,066
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

997
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:04,197
No, no, no. Not the Vatican

998
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,904
and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

999
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,536
And one that has been going on forever.

1000
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:11,868
On the one side stands the Priory

1001
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,794
and on the other an ancient group of despots

1002
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,290
with members hidden in high-ranking positions

1003
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,250
throughout the Church.

1004
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:23,634
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1005
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,966
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill

1006
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,926
the living descendants of Jesus Christ.

1007
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:30,852
- That's insane.
- Is it?

1008
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,680
What if the world discovers

1009
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:36,893
that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1010
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:40,650
The Vatican faces
a crisis of faith unprecedented.

1011
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,025
I've got a signal now, sir. It's ringing.

1012
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:50,324
Roger, look, I'm so sorry.
I've got tired of the weather here in France

1013
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:53,330
and could you make the plane ready for...

1014
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:57,375
Zürich.

1015
01:21:57,955 --> 01:21:59,423
Yes. No, we love Zürich.

1016
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,846
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1017
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:13,437
You're the one who lost them.

1018
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:15,181
You control every step of this investigation.

1019
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,941
You don't let anybody breathe.

1020
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,153
You're acting like you lost your mind.

1021
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:27,367
What is it with these two birds?

1022
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:34,326
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1023
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,454
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1024
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,907
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1025
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,368
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1026
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,121
I am the messenger of God.

1027
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,168
Did you kill my grandfather?

1028
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:26,760
I am the messenger...

1029
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:31,469
Each breath you take is a sin.

1030
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:35,389
No shadow will be safe again.

1031
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:40,316
For you will be hunted by angels.

1032
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,735
You believe in God?

1033
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,481
Your God doesn't forgive murderers.

1034
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,869
He burns them.

1035
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:05,082
Sophie.

1036
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,410
The Teacher will be pleased.

1037
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:35,783
What will you do once you have the Grail?

1038
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:36,909
Destroy it.

1039
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:40,664
The documents and the sarcophagus, of course.

1040
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:43,704
And the heir?

1041
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:51,003
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1042
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,180
There will be no need.

1043
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:58,102
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1044
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,895
There is no way to prove a living bloodline.

1045
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,224
But if you had to,

1046
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,899
would you do as councils have done before us?

1047
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,205
Christ...

1048
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:27,210
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1049
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:33,713
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1050
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,684
I need the flight plan.

1051
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,018
Ten minutes.

1052
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,351
I asked you to get it for me.

1053
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,400
I'm on break.

1054
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,448
Come back in 10 minutes.

1055
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:57,615
My nose! My nose!

1056
01:25:58,195 --> 01:25:59,617
The flight plan, please.

1057
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:00,781
You asshole!

1058
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,762
It's not "cross."

1059
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,302
"Spear"?

1060
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:24,433
What happened to her?

1061
01:26:25,222 --> 01:26:26,815
No one knows.

1062
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:30,527
Mary Magdalene lived out her days in hiding.

1063
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,735
And the zealots pursued her still,

1064
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:39,695
even in death,
trying to destroy proof of her existence.

1065
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:43,040
But she always had her Knights.

1066
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:45,584
Brave men sworn to defend her.

1067
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,461
You see, to worship before her sarcophagus,

1068
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:52,333
to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene,

1069
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,716
was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power,

1070
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:56,795
who were oppressed.

1071
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:01,721
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline

1072
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,474
until most believed her sarcophagus,

1073
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,143
the Holy Grail,

1074
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,110
was finally lost in time.

1075
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:23,029
What are you doing?

1076
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,787
At the chateau, you said,
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1077
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,334
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1078
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:32,665
- In Latin, sub rosa. Literal translation.
- "Beneath the rose."

1079
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:47,520
We need a mirror.

1080
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:50,565
Backwards. In the style of Leonardo himself.

1081
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:51,892
Thank you.

1082
01:27:56,772 --> 01:28:00,743
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred

1083
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:04,663
"His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred

1084
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:08,000
"You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb

1085
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:12,041
"It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb"

1086
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:16,175
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred"?

1087
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:20,174
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1088
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:23,678
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1089
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:24,849
Templars.

1090
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:28,020
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1091
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,220
Temple Church.

1092
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,477
Temple Church. If you'll excuse me, my dear,

1093
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:34,400
Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1094
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:36,312
Leigh.

1095
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:40,441
Harboring and transporting fugitives?

1096
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:43,782
You are already implicated enough.

1097
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:48,581
You and I, Robert, have observed history.

1098
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,580
Time has been our glass.

1099
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:54,796
We are in history now. Living it.

1100
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:58,125
Making it.

1101
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,427
"Implicated"?

1102
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:03,051
I am on a Grail quest.

1103
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,300
Forgive me, Robert,

1104
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,806
but you two may well have given this old man

1105
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:11,229
the greatest night of his life.

1106
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:14,224
Thank you.

1107
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,437
He's going to want more money.

1108
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,750
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1109
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:45,047
I've lost them. They flew to Switzerland.

1110
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:47,516
No extradition.

1111
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:56,563
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1112
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:03,740
What's going on, Bezu?

1113
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:09,614
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1114
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,535
Yes.

1115
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:20,332
A bishop of my order called me.

1116
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,793
He said a killer came to him in confession.

1117
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:25,712
His name was Robert Langdon.

1118
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,009
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

1119
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:32,928
That he would keep killing.

1120
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:35,772
He said I had to stop him.

1121
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:41,653
The bishop broke his vows to tell me this.

1122
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:45,236
He charged me to stop Robert Langdon.

1123
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:52,949
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1124
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,538
The bishop?

1125
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,962
God himself?

1126
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:10,716
They've changed their flight plan to London.

1127
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:43,132
I have them, tower.
Relay Hawker to land and hold on tarmac.

1128
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:42,649
- Secure the area!
- Wider!

1129
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:44,935
- Armed police!
- You two, round the back!

1130
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,484
Armed police! Put your hands in the air!

1131
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,486
- Three men up!
- Ready!

1132
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,863
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1133
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:56,029
I'm afraid that's easier said than done
in my case.

1134
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,411
Good morning.

1135
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:02,586
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1136
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,504
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives,

1137
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,332
and you may have a hostage onboard.

1138
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:08,883
I'm to take you all into custody.

1139
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:11,461
Sadly, I have an important
medical appointment

1140
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:12,761
which I can't afford to miss.

1141
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,054
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1142
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,974
This is serious, sir.
The French police are on their way. Stop!

1143
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:20,849
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

1144
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:22,306
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1145
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:24,436
If it's so important for you to stop us,

1146
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:26,735
then you're just going to have to shoot us.

1147
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:28,941
You can start with him.

1148
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:35,611
Search the plane.

1149
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:37,536
All right.

1150
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,422
I could run them over.

1151
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:57,882
Bad tip.

1152
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:01,220
Let him go.

1153
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:08,185
The French cannot be trusted.

1154
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:17,990
Everyone comfy?

1155
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:21,493
Biscuits?

1156
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,458
They didn't notice anything?

1157
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:28,251
Well, people rarely notice things
right in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1158
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:45,062
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

1159
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:46,515
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1160
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:50,026
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

1161
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:51,653
I am honored.

1162
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:56,742
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

1163
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:06,960
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1164
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:10,039
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

1165
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:13,129
This council does not exist.

1166
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,843
As it never has.

1167
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:22,468
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1168
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,942
Keep an eye out for the police.

1169
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:47,826
I must say, Robert, I'm quite impressed

1170
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,163
by the way you withstood my little airplane.

1171
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,457
Did he never tell you?

1172
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,965
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1173
01:35:58,044 --> 01:35:59,796
How old were you?

1174
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:01,005
Seven.

1175
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:07,095
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out

1176
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:09,101
to the echoes screaming back.

1177
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,729
When they found him, he was nearly catatonic.

1178
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,025
Help!

1179
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,528
It was a long time ago.

1180
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,480
Now, now, Robert.

1181
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:21,864
You, above all people, shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1182
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:31,794
Tell me, why has the Priory kept
the Grail location secret all these years?

1183
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:32,870
I don't know.

1184
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:36,166
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself,

1185
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:38,047
which is especially odd

1186
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:41,554
since legend suggests
he may not know his own true identity.

1187
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:50,555
Hello?

1188
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:53,975
Why do they make them so scary?

1189
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:00,731
It's cold.

1190
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:04,243
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred."

1191
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:16,915
So which tomb has an orb?

1192
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:22,629
Two wear tunics over their armor

1193
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:25,841
and two have full-length robes.

1194
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:28,642
Two are grasping swords.

1195
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:32,723
And one... Two are praying.

1196
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:36,776
This one has his arms at his sides.

1197
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:40,526
And this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1198
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:45,452
I don't see any orb that ought be on a tomb.

1199
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:49,198
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1200
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,123
Maybe. Over here, see.

1201
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:57,880
These aren't tombs.

1202
01:37:57,955 --> 01:38:00,424
- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.

1203
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,628
- They're effigies.
- What?

1204
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,804
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1205
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:06,430
This place is wrong.

1206
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:11,811
Can we go now? We should go.

1207
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:16,474
Sophie! No!

1208
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:19,856
Where is the keystone?

1209
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:22,230
Do not test me!

1210
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:23,610
- Let her go!
- Don't you hurt her.

1211
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:25,783
- Give me the keystone! Give it to me!
- Can you stop that?

1212
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:27,610
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1213
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:30,947
Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.

1214
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:33,666
Remy.

1215
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,543
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1216
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:43,176
Put it away. They're too close together.
You don't have a clear shot.

1217
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:46,671
- Yes, I do.
- Stop that. What do you think you're doing?

1218
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:53,303
Thank you, Professor.
For a moment, this was getting complicated.

1219
01:38:53,386 --> 01:38:55,480
This is absurd. For God's sake, man!

1220
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:01,152
That was satisfying.

1221
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:03,104
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1222
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,075
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1223
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:09,528
What?

1224
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,496
Here. You okay?

1225
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:23,374
Sorry.

1226
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,213
I don't think he's following.

1227
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:18,305
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1228
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:23,651
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

1229
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:35,955
He once whined to me about
the wasted space of so large a trunk.

1230
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,117
Let's see if he complains so now.

1231
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,124
Are you the Teacher?

1232
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:46,420
I am.

1233
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:52,715
Superbly done. You've been of great service.

1234
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:59,221
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

1235
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,476
You've done enough.

1236
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:08,234
We cannot let ego deter us from our goal.

1237
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:11,406
I understand.

1238
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,526
Good.

1239
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:21,618
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1240
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:23,920
I will dispose of the old man.

1241
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:26,706
Bless you, Silas.

1242
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:30,001
Teacher.

1243
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:39,927
Christ be with you.

1244
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:47,527
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1245
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:50,150
If we're gonna help Leigh, that's too long.

1246
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:03,368
Where are you going?

1247
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:05,579
Getting you a library card.

1248
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:11,334
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1249
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,920
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1250
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:23,767
That's great.

1251
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,895
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

1252
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:30,899
Thanks.

1253
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,906
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1254
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:38,577
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred."

1255
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:40,405
Compounding keywords.

1256
01:42:40,613 --> 01:42:43,492
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1257
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:48,121
Your precious treasure
was almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1258
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:54,794
Can you believe how well I did?

1259
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:58,507
I even convinced the monk.

1260
01:42:59,382 --> 01:43:01,305
I should be in theater.

1261
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:11,019
A toast to our success, Teacher.

1262
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:13,525
The end of the journey is near.

1263
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:19,365
Your identity shall go with me to the grave.

1264
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:28,457
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

1265
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:31,122
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings

1266
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:34,254
of some bloke named Alexander Pope.

1267
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:35,585
"A. Pope."

1268
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:38,963
Your grandfather was a genius.

1269
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:44,931
Come on.

1270
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:21,430
Emergency. Which service do you require?

1271
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:26,602
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1272
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:32,733
We've just had a 999 call.

1273
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:35,277
Triangulation leads back to Docklands.

1274
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:37,525
Caller was male. Claimed your two murderers

1275
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:40,199
are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1276
01:44:49,366 --> 01:44:53,462
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

1277
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:58,718
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1278
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:01,463
Gravity, for God sakes.

1279
01:45:02,838 --> 01:45:06,012
And if you choose to believe,

1280
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:10,517
he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1281
01:45:21,232 --> 01:45:23,701
But if he offended the Catholic Church,

1282
01:45:23,776 --> 01:45:27,656
the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1283
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:30,161
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1284
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:33,415
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred."

1285
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:36,293
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral was presided over

1286
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:40,502
by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

1287
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:43,087
A. Pope. His first initial.

1288
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,672
How did I miss that?

1289
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:46,469
Here.

1290
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:49,678
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

1291
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:52,313
An orb.

1292
01:45:52,388 --> 01:45:54,061
Yes. Which one?

1293
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:57,484
It's not possible to tell
if a particular orb is missing.

1294
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:01,190
"An orb with Rosy flesh and seeded womb."

1295
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:03,366
Solar system. The planets.

1296
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,943
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1297
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:08,700
See, our moon is missing.

1298
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:11,157
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

1299
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:14,247
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1300
01:46:16,579 --> 01:46:19,128
Robert. These tracks.

1301
01:46:20,249 --> 01:46:22,547
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1302
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:27,131
Teabing was here.

1303
01:46:28,549 --> 01:46:29,801
He was alone.

1304
01:46:31,635 --> 01:46:35,731
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did,

1305
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:39,435
others might call it God's will.

1306
01:46:40,686 --> 01:46:43,189
I believed that if I had the cryptex

1307
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:45,737
I could solve the riddle alone.

1308
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:49,157
But I was unworthy.

1309
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:50,283
But you...

1310
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:53,787
You have a reason to be here.

1311
01:46:53,866 --> 01:46:57,086
You're the last remaining guardian
of the Grail.

1312
01:46:57,828 --> 01:47:00,047
Your grandfather and the other sénéchaux

1313
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:02,045
would not have lied with dying breath

1314
01:47:02,124 --> 01:47:04,968
unless they knew their secret was preserved.

1315
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:10,262
How could you know Saunière's last words?

1316
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,388
Leigh.

1317
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:14,762
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1318
01:47:15,387 --> 01:47:16,809
You are a murderer.

1319
01:47:16,889 --> 01:47:20,143
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1320
01:47:20,225 --> 01:47:24,025
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1321
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,192
You self-righteous bastard!

1322
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,697
We... We need to just walk away.

1323
01:47:29,777 --> 01:47:31,575
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

1324
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:36,534
I'll do what I have to now.

1325
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:43,044
Anything.

1326
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:48,633
Do you understand?

1327
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:51,716
So now,

1328
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:55,219
can't we all be friends again?

1329
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:57,850
This way.

1330
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:37,937
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1331
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:40,935
I'm listening now.

1332
01:48:41,432 --> 01:48:42,934
For 2000 years

1333
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,480
the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind,

1334
01:48:48,147 --> 01:48:53,119
crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

1335
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:57,907
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering,

1336
01:48:58,449 --> 01:49:00,622
drive this church of lies to its knees.

1337
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:03,962
Armed police!

1338
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,127
Drop your weapon!

1339
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:10,669
Stop, Silas!

1340
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:26,318
We are betrayed, my son.

1341
01:49:27,311 --> 01:49:29,439
The living heir must be revealed.

1342
01:49:30,397 --> 01:49:32,695
Jesus must be shown for what he was.

1343
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:35,654
Not miraculous, simply man.

1344
01:49:37,154 --> 01:49:38,326
I'm sorry.

1345
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:41,875
Armed police!

1346
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:45,455
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1347
01:49:55,089 --> 01:49:57,683
Put it down now! Put it down!

1348
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:07,526
I am a ghost.

1349
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:11,355
The dark con can be exposed.

1350
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:16,410
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1351
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:19,325
The three of us.

1352
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:38,716
How is Silas?

1353
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:41,393
Is he... Is he alive?

1354
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:42,932
The monk?

1355
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:49,397
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

1356
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:52,487
Get me out of here, Fache.

1357
01:50:53,105 --> 01:50:54,231
Wait.

1358
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:00,746
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1359
01:51:01,405 --> 01:51:05,285
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

1360
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,250
I cannot be implicated here.

1361
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:11,624
There are still important works to be done.

1362
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:14,593
You used me.

1363
01:51:16,503 --> 01:51:18,551
God uses us all.

1364
01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:20,886
Help me, Fache.

1365
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:23,176
Take him.

1366
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:29,774
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

1367
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,898
I'm going to need a trace.

1368
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:36,614
Your Silas is dead.

1369
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:45,620
The Priory's sacred charge

1370
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:48,748
was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1371
01:51:49,661 --> 01:51:54,588
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1372
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,470
The Priory failed in their sacred charge.

1373
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:01,761
So, what choice did I have?

1374
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:07,809
I sought out the enemy.

1375
01:52:09,306 --> 01:52:13,277
I persuaded them, the Council of Shadows,
that I was an ally.

1376
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:17,569
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1377
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,989
Rector, I made them call me.

1378
01:52:21,944 --> 01:52:23,070
"Teacher."

1379
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:24,496
- Why don't you and I...
- No.

1380
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:27,165
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1381
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:29,076
Do it.

1382
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,786
No, I mean it. Down.

1383
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:34,672
Not you. No, my dear, you.

1384
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:39,386
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1385
01:52:40,337 --> 01:52:42,806
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1386
01:52:43,799 --> 01:52:47,429
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless

1387
01:52:47,511 --> 01:52:50,481
of those of different skin, of women.

1388
01:52:50,555 --> 01:52:53,274
You can put an end to all that.

1389
01:52:54,017 --> 01:52:57,191
You must explode the truth onto the world.

1390
01:52:58,522 --> 01:52:59,990
It's your duty.

1391
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:05,324
You know the answer to this riddle.

1392
01:53:07,114 --> 01:53:08,707
Open the cryptex,

1393
01:53:10,242 --> 01:53:11,960
and I'll put down the gun.

1394
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:32,189
I have no idea how.

1395
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:34,266
I don't know the code.

1396
01:53:34,349 --> 01:53:36,898
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1397
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:44,572
Like your grandfather, then.

1398
01:53:45,694 --> 01:53:48,197
Willing to die for your secret.

1399
01:53:49,865 --> 01:53:52,789
But, by the way
you've been looking at your hero,

1400
01:53:53,577 --> 01:53:57,923
I wonder, would you let him die for you?

1401
01:53:58,623 --> 01:54:01,001
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1402
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:03,257
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

1403
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,012
I don't know how.

1404
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:07,136
Open it or he dies.

1405
01:54:07,215 --> 01:54:09,309
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

1406
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:10,681
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

1407
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:12,104
Stop it!

1408
01:54:17,934 --> 01:54:19,936
She can't do it, Leigh.

1409
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:33,533
But give... Give me a moment.

1410
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:45,087
Robert.

1411
01:54:58,642 --> 01:54:59,689
What are you doing?

1412
01:55:00,394 --> 01:55:01,566
Please.

1413
01:56:21,766 --> 01:56:23,234
I'm sorry.

1414
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:34,575
I'm sorry.

1415
01:56:37,365 --> 01:56:38,366
No!

1416
01:56:46,917 --> 01:56:48,260
No, Robert!

1417
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:50,254
No!

1418
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:52,422
No.

1419
01:56:52,714 --> 01:56:54,933
The map. It's ruined.

1420
01:57:02,432 --> 01:57:03,900
The map is ruined.

1421
01:57:04,893 --> 01:57:06,236
The Grail.

1422
01:57:06,728 --> 01:57:07,854
It's lost.

1423
01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:10,031
The Grail is gone.

1424
01:57:10,398 --> 01:57:13,117
Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh.

1425
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:15,783
You taught me that.

1426
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:20,537
Armed police!

1427
01:57:20,617 --> 01:57:22,119
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1428
01:57:23,286 --> 01:57:24,333
Put the gun down.

1429
01:57:27,415 --> 01:57:29,759
Put the gun down.

1430
01:57:34,506 --> 01:57:37,476
That one. The old man.

1431
01:57:37,551 --> 01:57:38,552
You're under arrest!

1432
01:57:38,635 --> 01:57:41,013
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

1433
01:57:41,096 --> 01:57:43,098
if you do not mention, when questioned

1434
01:57:43,181 --> 01:57:45,309
something which you later rely on in court.

1435
01:57:45,392 --> 01:57:48,111
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1436
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:01,036
I'll have some questions for you.

1437
01:58:18,675 --> 01:58:20,723
Robert! Robert!

1438
01:58:20,802 --> 01:58:22,645
Robert! How could you do it?

1439
01:58:22,721 --> 01:58:24,598
How could you? Robert!

1440
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:27,609
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1441
01:58:27,976 --> 01:58:31,571
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1442
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:32,647
How could you?

1443
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,328
You couldn't! You solved it.

1444
01:58:41,781 --> 01:58:45,251
You took the scroll out before it broke!

1445
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:47,913
You solved it. You'll find it, Robert.

1446
01:58:47,996 --> 01:58:49,623
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1447
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:51,959
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her,

1448
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:54,136
and you'll set her free upon the world!

1449
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:57,339
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

1450
01:59:08,224 --> 01:59:12,730
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one.

1451
01:59:14,022 --> 01:59:16,366
The orb which fell from the heavens

1452
01:59:16,441 --> 01:59:18,114
and inspired Newton's life's work.

1453
01:59:18,193 --> 01:59:23,290
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1454
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:28,044
A-P-P-L-E.

1455
01:59:29,079 --> 01:59:30,296
Apple.

1456
01:59:44,928 --> 01:59:48,023
"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.

1457
01:59:48,098 --> 01:59:50,476
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates

1458
01:59:50,558 --> 01:59:52,526
"Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies

1459
01:59:52,602 --> 01:59:56,357
"She rests at last beneath the starry skies"

1460
01:59:58,441 --> 02:00:00,409
I think I know where she's gone.

1461
02:00:01,277 --> 02:00:03,780
I think the Grail has gone home.

1462
02:00:23,675 --> 02:00:26,178
Built by the Templars themselves.

1463
02:00:26,261 --> 02:00:28,605
Named for the original Rose Line.

1464
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,557
Rosslyn Chapel.

1465
02:00:31,725 --> 02:00:33,477
So this is it.

1466
02:00:34,477 --> 02:00:36,354
The gift at the end.

1467
02:00:37,313 --> 02:00:41,068
"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits."

1468
02:00:41,985 --> 02:00:44,784
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

1469
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:47,161
What was it?

1470
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,459
He called me a flatfoot.

1471
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:51,457
A beat cop of history.

1472
02:00:52,537 --> 02:00:54,164
A dumb policeman,

1473
02:00:54,831 --> 02:00:58,335
who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1474
02:00:58,418 --> 02:01:00,136
You know, his father was one.

1475
02:01:00,837 --> 02:01:02,760
A policeman.

1476
02:01:02,839 --> 02:01:07,561
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1477
02:01:11,431 --> 02:01:14,105
We are who we protect, I think.

1478
02:01:14,976 --> 02:01:16,694
What we stand up for.

1479
02:01:28,698 --> 02:01:30,075
Jewish.

1480
02:01:31,201 --> 02:01:33,920
Christian, Egyptian.

1481
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:37,628
Masonic, pagan.

1482
02:01:38,708 --> 02:01:40,426
Templar crosses.

1483
02:01:41,044 --> 02:01:42,421
Pyramids.

1484
02:01:43,171 --> 02:01:47,051
I think I've been here before.

1485
02:01:47,133 --> 02:01:48,350
Sophie?

1486
02:02:08,154 --> 02:02:09,872
A very long time ago.

1487
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:14,085
Come along, Sophie.

1488
02:02:29,259 --> 02:02:30,306
Sophie.

1489
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:32,470
Over here.

1490
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:43,778
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates."

1491
02:02:44,274 --> 02:02:46,777
Pagan symbols for male and female.

1492
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:50,739
Fused as one.

1493
02:02:50,822 --> 02:02:52,950
As the pagans would have wanted.

1494
02:02:54,701 --> 02:02:56,419
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1495
02:03:02,667 --> 02:03:05,011
We're just gonna be a moment.

1496
02:03:19,851 --> 02:03:21,148
Robert.

1497
02:03:47,253 --> 02:03:50,427
"Adorned in masters' loving art, she lies."

1498
02:03:50,506 --> 02:03:55,933
"She rests at last beneath the starry skies."

1499
02:04:15,531 --> 02:04:17,204
The fleur-de-lis.

1500
02:05:08,292 --> 02:05:09,384
She was here.

1501
02:05:12,422 --> 02:05:13,969
Her sarcophagus.

1502
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:17,643
Mary Magdalene.

1503
02:05:19,429 --> 02:05:21,352
The Holy Grail herself.

1504
02:05:23,016 --> 02:05:24,643
She was here.

1505
02:05:24,726 --> 02:05:26,353
Where did she go?

1506
02:05:27,437 --> 02:05:29,815
Did the Church finally get her?

1507
02:05:44,328 --> 02:05:47,047
This is incredible. Look at this.

1508
02:05:47,123 --> 02:05:50,468
Look at this.
These records go back thousands of years.

1509
02:05:51,627 --> 02:05:54,130
They date back to the death of Christ.

1510
02:05:56,799 --> 02:06:00,144
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1511
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:26,080
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1512
02:06:27,580 --> 02:06:30,254
How was I ever supposed to
figure all this out?

1513
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:33,003
When you and your grandfather fought,

1514
02:06:33,086 --> 02:06:35,805
was it something about your past?

1515
02:06:37,757 --> 02:06:39,509
How could you know that?

1516
02:06:40,176 --> 02:06:42,895
About how your parents died?

1517
02:06:43,971 --> 02:06:45,518
Sophie?

1518
02:06:47,892 --> 02:06:50,145
It was during primary school.

1519
02:06:51,729 --> 02:06:53,731
I was in his library.

1520
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:57,198
Doing research.

1521
02:06:57,276 --> 02:06:59,904
I was trying to find out about my family.

1522
02:07:00,071 --> 02:07:02,369
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1523
02:07:03,157 --> 02:07:05,455
I wanted to know about them.

1524
02:07:06,244 --> 02:07:08,212
But I couldn't find any records.

1525
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:11,207
Not of their death,

1526
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:14,460
not of the accident.

1527
02:07:15,419 --> 02:07:17,922
I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember,

1528
02:07:18,005 --> 02:07:19,177
but he would never tell me.

1529
02:07:19,257 --> 02:07:20,975
I told you, no.

1530
02:07:23,386 --> 02:07:24,888
But why can't I?

1531
02:07:25,221 --> 02:07:27,064
He stood over me,

1532
02:07:28,766 --> 02:07:30,814
and he wouldn't let me leave.

1533
02:07:31,018 --> 02:07:32,861
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1534
02:07:33,354 --> 02:07:35,027
Never look for them, Sophie.

1535
02:07:35,273 --> 02:07:36,490
Promise me.

1536
02:07:37,942 --> 02:07:39,068
Swear it!

1537
02:07:39,777 --> 02:07:40,903
Swear it to me!

1538
02:07:51,581 --> 02:07:53,549
I kept my promise.

1539
02:07:57,170 --> 02:07:59,468
The next week he sent me to boarding school.

1540
02:08:01,674 --> 02:08:04,644
One weekend, I came home unexpectedly.

1541
02:08:06,262 --> 02:08:08,356
And what I saw my grandfather doing...

1542
02:08:09,974 --> 02:08:11,601
Some ritual.

1543
02:08:13,603 --> 02:08:15,196
I was so frightened.

1544
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:22,032
We hardly ever spoke again.

1545
02:08:25,656 --> 02:08:27,283
Do you have any...

1546
02:08:28,075 --> 02:08:30,794
Any memories of your grandfather
before the accident?

1547
02:08:31,871 --> 02:08:33,623
Before your parents were killed?

1548
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:37,301
Yeah. No, I don't know.

1549
02:08:38,461 --> 02:08:39,633
Why?

1550
02:08:42,381 --> 02:08:44,759
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1551
02:09:04,237 --> 02:09:05,955
These are my parents.

1552
02:09:08,241 --> 02:09:09,584
My brother.

1553
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:13,208
And this is you, isn't it?

1554
02:09:18,167 --> 02:09:21,842
The paper says the entire family was killed.

1555
02:09:22,338 --> 02:09:25,683
The mother, the father, the boy, six.

1556
02:09:27,927 --> 02:09:30,146
And the girl, four.

1557
02:09:31,847 --> 02:09:34,942
But your name was never Saunière.

1558
02:09:35,017 --> 02:09:36,564
It's Saint-Clair.

1559
02:09:39,939 --> 02:09:42,283
It's one of the oldest families in France.

1560
02:09:42,942 --> 02:09:46,196
It's from a line of the Merovingian kings.

1561
02:09:55,288 --> 02:09:57,086
Royal blood.

1562
02:09:59,125 --> 02:10:00,718
I was so wrong.

1563
02:10:02,378 --> 02:10:06,679
Saunière didn't want you
to help guard the secret of the Holy Grail.

1564
02:10:08,384 --> 02:10:09,727
Sophie,

1565
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:14,064
you are the secret.

1566
02:10:15,725 --> 02:10:17,648
You survived the accident.

1567
02:10:18,477 --> 02:10:21,230
If it even was an accident.

1568
02:10:21,314 --> 02:10:23,237
The Priory found out.

1569
02:10:23,899 --> 02:10:27,073
Somehow they concealed the fact
that you were alive.

1570
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:30,581
They hid you with the Grand Master himself,

1571
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:33,458
who raised you as his own.

1572
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:36,542
According to all of this,

1573
02:10:37,997 --> 02:10:39,749
Princess Sophie,

1574
02:10:43,461 --> 02:10:45,088
you are the heir.

1575
02:10:47,131 --> 02:10:49,225
The end of the bloodline.

1576
02:10:50,801 --> 02:10:53,850
You are the last living descendent

1577
02:10:55,181 --> 02:10:57,024
of Jesus Christ.

1578
02:11:42,561 --> 02:11:43,938
What is this?

1579
02:11:45,981 --> 02:11:47,198
Sophie?

1580
02:11:50,444 --> 02:11:51,570
Who are you?

1581
02:11:51,654 --> 02:11:54,624
There have been many names.

1582
02:11:54,698 --> 02:11:56,325
The keepers.

1583
02:11:57,368 --> 02:11:59,166
Guardians.

1584
02:11:59,245 --> 02:12:01,794
The Priory of Sion.

1585
02:12:01,872 --> 02:12:06,924
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you,

1586
02:12:07,586 --> 02:12:09,179
Jacques Saunière.

1587
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:14,309
He would have wanted you to know

1588
02:12:14,385 --> 02:12:16,888
that he loved you very much.

1589
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:22,026
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now

1590
02:12:22,101 --> 02:12:25,275
as they have always protected our family.

1591
02:12:27,857 --> 02:12:29,951
I gave you up once

1592
02:12:30,734 --> 02:12:33,533
knowing I might never see you again.

1593
02:12:37,241 --> 02:12:39,164
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1594
02:12:40,286 --> 02:12:43,711
I have prayed for this moment

1595
02:12:43,789 --> 02:12:45,666
for a very long time.

1596
02:12:47,293 --> 02:12:49,421
Welcome home, child.

1597
02:13:02,266 --> 02:13:03,483
Hey.

1598
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:17,665
She has some things she wants to tell me.

1599
02:13:18,657 --> 02:13:21,035
About my family.

1600
02:13:27,541 --> 02:13:28,758
What will you do?

1601
02:13:29,919 --> 02:13:33,423
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1602
02:13:34,256 --> 02:13:36,759
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1603
02:13:40,179 --> 02:13:41,806
She said when Saunière died

1604
02:13:41,889 --> 02:13:44,688
he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1605
02:13:44,767 --> 02:13:49,398
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

1606
02:13:52,149 --> 02:13:54,117
What would you do, Robert?

1607
02:13:55,069 --> 02:13:57,288
Okay, maybe there is no proof.

1608
02:13:57,363 --> 02:13:59,536
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1609
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:03,336
But, Sophie, the only thing that matters
is what you believe.

1610
02:14:04,745 --> 02:14:07,874
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man.

1611
02:14:07,957 --> 02:14:09,959
A human inspiration. That's it.

1612
02:14:10,834 --> 02:14:13,553
That's all the evidence has ever proved.

1613
02:14:15,005 --> 02:14:16,131
But...

1614
02:14:17,091 --> 02:14:18,968
When I was a boy...

1615
02:14:21,303 --> 02:14:25,183
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about,

1616
02:14:28,519 --> 02:14:30,988
I thought I was going to die, Sophie.

1617
02:14:33,107 --> 02:14:35,235
What I did,

1618
02:14:35,317 --> 02:14:36,694
I prayed.

1619
02:14:38,028 --> 02:14:39,621
I prayed

1620
02:14:39,697 --> 02:14:42,667
to Jesus to keep me alive,

1621
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:44,288
so I could see my parents again,

1622
02:14:44,368 --> 02:14:46,462
so I could go to school again,

1623
02:14:47,496 --> 02:14:49,749
so I could play with my dog.

1624
02:14:51,125 --> 02:14:54,129
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

1625
02:14:56,338 --> 02:14:59,182
Why does it have to be human or divine?

1626
02:14:59,258 --> 02:15:01,181
Maybe human is divine.

1627
02:15:02,469 --> 02:15:04,142
Why couldn't Jesus have been a father

1628
02:15:04,221 --> 02:15:07,020
and still been capable of all those miracles?

1629
02:15:07,683 --> 02:15:10,482
Like turning water into wine?

1630
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:13,690
Well, who knows? His blood is your blood.

1631
02:15:14,523 --> 02:15:17,618
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1632
02:15:18,193 --> 02:15:21,322
Maybe you healed my phobia with your hands.

1633
02:15:21,405 --> 02:15:24,409
And maybe you're a knight on a Grail quest.

1634
02:15:27,244 --> 02:15:29,793
Well, here's the question.

1635
02:15:30,664 --> 02:15:33,383
A living descendent of Jesus Christ,

1636
02:15:34,918 --> 02:15:37,467
would she destroy faith?

1637
02:15:38,005 --> 02:15:40,884
Or would she renew it?

1638
02:15:43,552 --> 02:15:46,726
So again I say,
what matters is what you believe.

1639
02:15:49,058 --> 02:15:50,355
Thank you.

1640
02:15:52,519 --> 02:15:53,736
For bringing me here.

1641
02:15:55,773 --> 02:15:58,276
For letting him choose you,

1642
02:15:59,151 --> 02:16:00,368
Sir Robert.

1643
02:16:10,621 --> 02:16:11,622
You take care.

1644
02:16:13,207 --> 02:16:14,333
Yes.

1645
02:16:38,941 --> 02:16:40,113
Hey.

1646
02:16:53,122 --> 02:16:54,123
Nope.

1647
02:16:55,457 --> 02:16:57,710
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1648
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:02,507
Godspeed.

1649
02:18:01,398 --> 02:18:02,775
Bloodline.

1650
02:18:06,195 --> 02:18:07,538
Rose Line.

1651
02:18:14,328 --> 02:18:16,376
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1652
02:19:07,923 --> 02:19:11,518
"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.

1653
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:18,105
"Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies.

1654
02:19:34,241 --> 02:19:37,871
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates.

1655
02:20:17,326 --> 02:20:20,830
"She rests at last beneath starry skies."
